* Removed App Engine
* ant build script
* prepare for GitHub	

==2014-04-03==
* Updated to appengine-java-sdk-1.7.7
* Small fixes due to change to Java 7 and new appengine.

==Roadmap==
* Better model instand and period not with ical:dtstart and ical:dtend but a period dimension with a label "2013-01-01 to 2013-09-01" (or similar).
* Add other concepts, not only us-gaap and us-gaap1, but also cost etc.
* Also model information about units and decimals of numeric observations
* Apparently, many datasets cannot be represented, e.g., http://edgarwrap.ontologycentral.com/archive/1556593/0001193125-13-373521#ds

==2013-09-19==
* Added proper label in English to the dataset.

==2013-09-18==
* Problem: Some observations may get empty double obsValues, e.g., http://edgarwrap.ontologycentral.com/archive/909832/0001193125-10-230379#ds at line 751, column 299 [1] (was not too easy to find since we were looking for "XMLSchema#double"/>".
* Let's see how this is stored in XBRL. According to XBRL spec [2], tuples can have value nil (xsi:nil="true").
* Since QB is restricted to describe existing values (IC-17. All measures present in measures dimension cube in [3]), we need to remove those observations from the description. 
* Solution: We match on those tags that do not have an xsi:nil=true.

* Problem: Some values are no numbers
** So far, we have simply tested whether value has fewer than 20 characters.
** Now, we properly check, whether number

* Problem: Failed specification check: IC-4. Dimensions have range. Every dimension declared in a qb:DataStructureDefinition must have a declared rdfs:range.
** ObsValue Measure does not need a range (actually, there should be one defined? No there is not [5]). Thus, we should define one, later.
** issuer does have as range a Business Entity (resolveable)
** segment does not have a range, we should put xsd:string as range
** dtstart and dtend also have a range specified at [4]
** subject does not have a range at [4] specified. We might be able to create a code list, but for now we just define edgar:Subject as type for degenerated dimension.

* Problem: Some observations serve a date, some a period.
** Solution: We always describe ical:start and end, and use date for both (instant).
